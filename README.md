# UFC Performace Analytics and Visualizer
Developed by Mateo Shelton, Patricio Peña-Aguilar, and Sohrab Sadjadi

# Project Overview
This project does a deep dive into UFC fighter performance. Using R and a data-driven approach this tool allows you to organize UFC Fighter data to forecast current trends and predict future fights.

# Tech Stack
Language: R (4.5.1)

Environment: RStudio

Key Libraries: ggplot2, tidyverse, plotly

# Key Features
- Explaratory Data Analysis: Identifies correlations between physcial attributes (i.e. Height, Weight) and UFC Statistics (i.e. Significant Strikes, Takedowns)

- Interactive Data Visualizations: High quality plots that visualize complex data points into disgestable insights

# Methodology and Statistics
This project focuses on more than just making charts. As a Statistics majors our goal was to show meaningful connections between well known and unknown fight statistics to better understand a fighters style and effectiveness.

- Data Cleaning/KPI Indentification: Handled irrelevant data to streamline the data analysis process

- Reproducibilty: Structured the data so any user could plug in the most recent data and generate identical visualizations
